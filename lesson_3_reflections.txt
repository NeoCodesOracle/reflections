When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

	When working on a project with a group to allow for sharing and
  	collaborating with team members. Remote repositories are specially
  	helpful when other's  work is dependant on the work we do, i.e. we
  	are working on a part of the project that is tied to other parts
	(more so than other parts since everything in a project is tied
	together).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might always want to push changes manually because we will
	not always NEED to push all changes in our repository.
